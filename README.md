# Problem Statement and Purpose of Proposed System
Inefficient and ineffective supply chain management (SCM) can result in delays, excess inventory, lost sales, and increased costs, which can negatively impact a company's profitability and customer satisfaction. To address these challenges, there is a growing need for optimized SCM solutions that can streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. However, traditional SCM systems often lack the scalability, flexibility, and real-time data exchange capabilities needed to support modern supply chain networks. Therefore, there is a need to develop cloud-based SCM solutions that can leverage the benefits of cloud computing, such as scalability, accessibility, and real-time data analytics, to enhance supply chain performance and efficiency. The goal of this project is to develop an optimized cloud-based SCM solution that can streamline operations, elevate efficiency, and provide real-time visibility and collaboration across the supply chain network.
